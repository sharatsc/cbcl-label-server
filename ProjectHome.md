Introduction

This code provides yet another matlab implementation for the computational model of the ventral stream developed by [CBCL](http://cbcl.mit.edu). The original matlab version written by Serre and Bileschi can be accessed [here](http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/standardmodel/index.html). The code is hard-wired to compute only upto 4 layers (S1,C1,S2,C2).

The project relies upon openCV to implement the image processing operations. It was modified by Tony Ezzat to make the outputs 100% compatible with the matlab version of the code.
